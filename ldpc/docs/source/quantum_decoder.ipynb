    "# Belief propagation + localized statistics decoding (BP+LSD)\n",
    "\n",
    "The belief propagation + localized statistics decoder (BP+LSD) is a parallel inversion-based decoder for quantum LDPC codes (see our paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.???). Similar to OSD, the LSD algorithm solves the decoding problem through matrix inversion. However, matrix inversion is performed on local error clusters rather than over the entire parity check matrix. This considerably speeds up decoding relative to BP+OSD for large parity check matrices. Higher-order reprocessing, using either the 'combination sweep' or 'exhaustive' strategy can also be performed locally for each cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "An advantage of LSD (over OSD) is that the number of bp iterations (`BpDecoder.max_iter`) can be set to a small number (experiment with this, but we find ~30 usually suffices) without reducing runtime. The decoder then relies more on the post-processor, but this does not matter as the runtime of the LSD algorithm scales (roughly) with the error rate rather than the size of the parity check matrix (as is the case for BP+OSD).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `LDPC` implementation of BP+LSD inherits from the `ldpc.BpDecoder` class. The setup is therefore very similar, with only two extra parameters to specify the `lsd_method` and the `lsd_order`. Note that for higher-order reprocessing, `lsd_cs-w` and `osd_cs-w` are not entirely equivalent, so expect some differences. \n",

Belief-find first attempts to solve the decoding using belief propagation. If this fails, a union-find decoder is run as a post-processor using the output of BP to guide cluster growth. The `LDPC` package implements two versions of belief-find:\n",

    "1) **Peeling belief-find**. This approach uses a peeling decoder to solve the local decoding problem in each cluster. Peeling uinon-find is limited to decoding codes that have point like syndromes. e.g, the surface and toric codes. The peeling version of union-find decoder was first proposed by Delfosse & Nickerson in (https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06218). Peeling belief-find was first proposed and implemented by Oscar Higgott (https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04948).\n",
